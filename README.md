# Shape Completion (tensorflow)

This is the project for 3D **shape completion** with generative adversarial network.
~~TensorFlow implementation of [Image-to-Image Translation Using Conditional Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.07004v1.pdf) that learns a mapping from input images to output images.~~

Here are some results generated by the authors of paper:


## Setup
1. First 
2. Second 
  * Unorder list.
3. Third
  1. sub order list 
4. Forth
    You can proper subgraph

## Results
Here is the results generated from this implementation:

- Facades:

More results on other datasets coming soon!

**Note**: To avoid the fast convergence of D (discriminator) network, G (generator) network is updated twice for each D network update, which differs from original paper but same as [DCGAN-tensorflow](https://github.com/carpedm20/DCGAN-tensorflow), which this project based on.

## Train
Code currently supports [CMP Facades](http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/~tylecr1/facade/) dataset. To reproduce results presented above, it takes 200 epochs of training. Exact computing time depends on own hardware conditions.

## Test
Test the model on validation set of [CMP Facades](http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/~tylecr1/facade/) dataset. It will generate synthesized images provided corresponding labels under directory `./test`.
